AudioStreamer Example app
============

### NOTE: This project uses a plugin that had a bug where the remote control buttons (say on the lock screen) were not sending the play/pause to the streaming plugin. Because of this I abandoned it in my own project and decided to use HTML5 Audio (`new Audio()`) instead for my own PhoneGap Radio Streaming project. I have now created a little example app using that tech instead at https://github.com/devgeeks/ExampleHTML5AudioStreaming

Why is this here?
------------

Someone asked for an example of using the plugin and I thought it would be a good idea to make a basic app that showed how the plugin worked.

NOTE: It appears that a very recent version of PhoneGap is needed at least on Lion. Try the version in this issues thread if you have issues:
